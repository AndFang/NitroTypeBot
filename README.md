# NitroTypeBot
A python script built using tkinter and customtkinter, selenium, and keyboard to play [Nitro Type](https://www.nitrotype.com/race) utilizing a typing bot which can type at various speeds.

## Background
What started as some Friday shenanigans quickly turn into some friendly competitiveness of seeing how fast one can type. It started out by quickly typing the alphabet on [Speed Typing Online](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/games/type-the-alphabet.php) was brought into the context of Nitro Type. From there the additions and features grew. Eventually this turned into a GUI which allowed one to log in and also control the speed at which they typed.
